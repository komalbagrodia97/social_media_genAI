1728455460892692702,"Then Jesus said, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.‚Äù - Luke 23:34.

Every single one of us has sinned. We all have fallen short of God's perfect and wonderful standard, and yet He pursued reconciliation for us so passionately that He sent Himself to die in order to bring us together with Him.

What a perfect example of forgiveness! Even while God should have called us enemies, He call us ""children"" instead.

Starting on November 26, 2023, God wants us to do as He did and FORGIVE those who have wronged us. Extend hands of mercy. Humble ourselves and let go of our anger.

If we do this, He promises that He will HEAL our land.

Every single one of us has sinned. We all have fallen short of God's perfect and wonderful standard, and yet He pursued reconciliation for us so passionately that He sent Himself to die in order to bring us together with Him.

What a perfect example of forgiveness! Even while God should have called us enemies, He call us ""children"" instead.

Starting on November 26, 2023, God wants us to do as He did and FORGIVE those who have wronged us. Extend hands of mercy. Humble ourselves and let go of our anger.

If we do this, He promises that He will HEAL our land.

In 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the Presidency.

Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again‚Äîand making Donald Trump a loser‚Äîagain.

When I was elected President, I said the days of the backbone of the Democratic Party being at the back of the line were over. That was a promise made and a promise kept. Now, you are First In The Nation.

The stakes in this election could not be higher. There are extreme and dangerous voices at work in the country‚Äîled by Donald Trump‚Äîwho are determined to divide our nation and take us backward. We cannot let that happen. We‚Äôve come a long way these past four years‚Äîwith America now having the strongest economy in the world and among the lowest inflation of any major economy.

1732491860751634904,"Who is Jesus Christ?

Corporate churches and their pastors/priests rarely get into the meat of The Word. They present Christ as simply the Son of God when there is alot more to The Messiah that's either not focused upon or not known. This leaves the people without a deeper understanding. So let's dig and see what Christ says about Himself - Who He is, Where He has been, and When He has been.

First, let's establish another of Christ's Name that's rarely referenced.

Rev 19:13¬† And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.

Christ has named Himself ""The Word of God"". So when you say ""Let's study The Word"" you're actually saying ""Let's study Jesus Christ."" Having established His name is The Word, let's check out who Jesus Christ said He was and is.
Joh 14:8¬† Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.¬†
Joh 14:9¬† Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?¬†

Christ clarifies to Philip that He is God The Father of the Old Testament. If you have seen The Father you have seen The son. In Hebrews it is reiterated.

Heb 1:3¬† Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;¬†

Christ is the exact image of God The Father. Why? Because they are the same God.

Having established who Christ is, let's let The Word (Jesus Christ) tell us where and when Christ has been. In John we have the following verses. Remember, The Word of God = Jesus Christ.

Joh 1:1¬† In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.¬†
Joh 1:2¬† The same was in the beginning with God.¬†
Joh 1:3¬† All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.¬†

So we see that it was Jesus Christ that was there since the beginnning of the creation. Let's play a little Word game, pun intended, to drive the point home. 

Joh 1:1¬† In the beginning was Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was with God, and Jesus Christ was God.¬†
Joh 1:2¬† Jesus Christ was in the beginning with God.¬†
Joh 1:3¬† All things were made by Jesus Christ; and without Jesus Christ was not any thing made that was made.¬†

Clarity. The Word clarifies Himself if one digs a little. Hebrews says the same thing.

Heb 11:3¬† Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God (Jesus Christ), so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.¬†

Now let's go the very beginning of The Bible, the book of Genesis with the new understanding of what The Word was telling us about Jesus Christ.

Gen 1:1¬† In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

Let's apply the same Word game as above.

Gen 1:1¬† In the beginning Jesus Christ created the heaven and the earth.

Christ clarified who He was and is to us. 

We established the Who: The Word = Christ = God The Father.

The Where: With God The Father.

The When: In the beginning.

That's why Jesus Christ is referred to in the book of Revelation as The Alpha and The Omega, the beginning and the end. For He has always been, and will always be. He is the Circle that connects the beginning and the end. He is Eternity. He is The One True God.

In Christ's Name

1728455460892692702,"Then Jesus said, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.‚Äù - Luke 23:34.

Every single one of us has sinned. We all have fallen short of God's perfect and wonderful standard, and yet He pursued reconciliation for us so passionately that He sent Himself to die in order to bring us together with Him.

What a perfect example of forgiveness! Even while God should have called us enemies, He call us ""children"" instead.

Starting on November 26, 2023, God wants us to do as He did and FORGIVE those who have wronged us. Extend hands of mercy. Humble ourselves and let go of our anger.

If we do this, He promises that He will HEAL our land.

Upsides
- Tons of useful new generative features - can write letters, craft trip plans, create images, etc. All the good stuff
- Notably better semantic understanding of random fact-based questions

Downsides
- It's missing some classic Google Assistant features like home control and adding to shopping lists
- The new pop-up UI is a little more complex, but you can get used to it
- Renaming it is gonna confuse a lot of people for no reason

It's rolling out today and you can play with it: https://t.co/KM905oBEQM",en,Tweet,1450,10423,683,365,1868658.0,2024-02-08 09:08:32,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1755594327227527168/pu/vid/avc1/1080x1080/sPcCOKXfkugsrfOd.mp4?tag=14,mkbhd,0.022099190540783242

1740755845946692057,"I love electric cars, but as I've said on the Auto Focus channel there are certain TYPES of vehicles that with today's tech are BEST when made electric. Take a luxury sedan - what do you want from the best one? It better be super smooth, comfortable, quiet (and probably expensive). A new electric version? Literally the smoothest, quietest, most spacious version ever. (also probably expensive). Total win across the board. 

But sports cars are not one of those things. Yet. The power is there, duh, but there's also a ton of weight that comes with it. And the best sports car across the board rivers best when it's lighter, nimble and reliable. The gap is closing (and hybrids are getting VERY good) out the apex sports car is still not fully electric. 

Honestly I was nervous to get it after watching basically every review on the internet proclaiming this to be the ""best car ever created"" and ""too good"" but the professionals were on to something. I'm not ready to say it's the best car ever made, but most of its traits are already top 5% of any car I've ever experienced: Handling, steering feel, balance, physical switches, interior build quality, speakers, acceleration (ok it's 8/10ths as quick as PLAID)

The tech is actually kinda bad compared to new EVs. The backup camera is weak, there's no phone key, the app does almost nothing, no dashcam, wireless CarPlay/Android Auto are welcome but also honestly still not very good. I don't even think that's a hot take.

I've compared smartphones to the Porsche 911's incremental improvement model for years. When the category is young, we call it lazy. When the category is mature, we call it refinement. And I'm only 700 miles in, but damn this car is REFINED as hell.

Today, my Administration is doing something about it. Let me explain:
 
Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on research, discovery, and development of new prescription drugs. And while I firmly believe that the strength of a nation can be measured by the boldness of its science, the quality of its research, and the progress it helps bring forth, I also believe that the folks who paid for the research ‚Äì you ‚Äì ought to be able to access and afford the final product.
 
That's why my Administration is proposing that if a drug made using taxpayer funds is not reasonably available to Americans, the government reserves the right to ""march in"" and license that drug to another manufacturer who could sell it for less.
 
This is an important step toward ending Big Pharma price gouging.

I did everything I could to talk him out of taking that shot, and my father said, ""Son, you and your Alex Jones are nuts,"" and then he went on to tell me, ""If Trump can take the shot then so can I.""

I knew I couldn't stop him.

He was a 76 year old Vietnam War veteran and he needed surgery for a pinched nerve in his back and our hospital wouldn't give him a bed for 4 to 6 weeks unless he took the covid vaccine. 

They coerced him into taking the shot by saying they didn't have any beds for him unless he took the shot and that was a lie.

He took the shot, got his surgery, and went home, and then he got a fever and passed in his sleep three weeks later.

They told us he overdosed on pain pills but then we got the death certificate and it said he died of Covid. 

I'm still voting for @realDonaldTrump
because I believe if the democrats and @MichelleObama win, the death shots will continue just like they have been since the Biden administration has been in power.

The üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüíâ is still being given to people everyday all over the country. 

I believe if Trump admits he was wrong about covid psyops and death shots during this election race they will blame him for all of it and he will lose to Michelle Obama. 

Trump has to come back and then go to war with everyone who is responsible for the üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüíâ and I believe he'll do that.

What other choices do we have?

You think @NikkiHaley will stop the üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüíâ?

There is nobody to support besides @realDonaldTrump.

1737260590798671982,"This is what an *actual* attack on democracy looks like: in an un-American, unconstitutional, and *unprecedented* decision, a cabal of Democrat judges are barring Trump from the ballot in Colorado. Having tried every trick in the book to eliminate President Trump from running in this election, the bipartisan Establishment is now deploying a new tactic to bar him from ever holding office again: the 14th Amendment. I pledge to *withdraw* from the Colorado GOP primary unless Trump is also allowed to be on the state‚Äôs ballot, and I demand that Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, and Nikki Haley to do the same immediately - or else they are tacitly endorsing this illegal maneuver which will have disastrous consequences for our country.
¬†
Today‚Äôs decision is the latest election interference tactic to silence political opponents and swing the election for whatever puppet the Democrats put up this time by depriving Americans of the right to vote for their candidate of choice.
¬†
The 14th Amendment was part of the ‚ÄúReconstruction Amendments‚Äù that were ratified following the Civil War. It was passed to prohibit former Confederate military and political leaders from holding high federal or state office. These men had clearly taken part in a rebellion against the United States: the Civil War. That makes it all the more absurd that a left-wing group in Colorado is asking a federal court to disqualify the 45th President on the same grounds, equating his speech to rebellion against the United States.

And there‚Äôs another legal problem: Trump is not a former ‚Äúofficer of the United States,‚Äù as that term is used in the Constitution, meaning Section 3 does not apply. As the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), an ‚Äúofficer of the United States‚Äù is someone appointed by the President to aid him in his duties under Article II, Section 2. The term does not apply to elected officials, and certainly not to the President himself. 
¬†
The Framers of the 14th Amendment would be appalled to see this narrow provision‚Äîintended to bar former U.S. officials who switched to the Confederacy from seeking public office‚Äîbeing weaponized by a sitting President and his political allies to prevent a former President from seeking reelection. Our country is becoming unrecognizable to our Founding Fathers.",en,Retweet,3361,127034,30911,7716,6255031.0,2023-12-19 18:56:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,,RealAlexJones,-0.7150263413207487

House Speaker Rep. Mike Johnson has reportedly condemned Biden's request for an additional $200 million in military aid for Ukraine. 

Johnson upheld his party's position of withholding support for Ukraine aid until further measures were taken to fortify the southern border of the United States.

This decision comes amid Biden's recent aid announcement during Zelenskyy's visit to the White House. 

Despite the U.S. having approximately $4.4 billion remaining in weapons to provide from Pentagon stockpiles, Johnson's rejection reflects a growing debate over the U.S. financial commitment to Ukraine.

Adding to the situation's complexity, Zelenskyy unexpectedly canceled a scheduled speech to the U.S. Congress. The reasons for the cancellation are not immediately apparent, but it coincides with a crucial period for Ukraine, particularly in terms of international support and aid. 

These developments highlight the ongoing discussions and differing views within the U.S. government regarding the extent of support for Ukraine.

1733804408973205555,"As the media flips out over @ElonMusk restoring Alex Jones account (@RealAlexJones), it's  important to point out to everyone the REAL reason Alex was banned from Twitter in the first place back in 2018.  

And contrary to popular belief it was NOT because he entertained some conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook, as crazy as they were.  

Twitter specifically cited the Oliver Darcy confrontation, who is a public figure (working for CNN), which took place on public property, while Darcy was working in the capacity of a reporter at the time, outside a congressional hearing about censorship on social media.    

They claimed it was ""harassment"" because he told him off for working to get him banned off all the other platforms.  The irony is too thick to even describe.  Twitter held out after he was unpersoned by YouTube and Facebook, but then after he humiliated the CNN clown, that was cited as the reason for the ban by Twitter's Trust and Safety account.  

People should watch Tucker Carlson's interview with Alex Jones to see the real Alex, not just his flaws and mistakes that the media spent years amplifying and trying to make his identity. 

 He is a genius, but like most geniuses, it's counterbalanced by equal sized flaws. 

But he was banned for bogus reasons in order to silence him, not because of a whacky conspiracy theory from years earlier he entertained, but because when he's firing on all cylinders and on point, he's a wrecking ball to the corrupt political establishment and was revealing too much about how the power structures work.

Every single one of us has sinned. We all have fallen short of God's perfect and wonderful standard, and yet He pursued reconciliation for us so passionately that He sent Himself to die in order to bring us together with Him.

What a perfect example of forgiveness! Even while God should have called us enemies, He call us ""children"" instead.

Starting on November 26, 2023, God wants us to do as He did and FORGIVE those who have wronged us. Extend hands of mercy. Humble ourselves and let go of our anger.

If we do this, He promises that He will HEAL our land.
