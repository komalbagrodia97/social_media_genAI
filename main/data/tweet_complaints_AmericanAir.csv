@AmericanAir  I have never arrived an 1:45 minutes early and been at risk of missing a domestic flight. You have no one working. What are you doing ?
Hey  @AmericanAir  - why close the gate 10 minutes before a flight is set to depart while a dozen passengers for THAT flight are sitting on the runway for 25+ minutes waiting to deplane?    With no other flights out until the next day.     Thanks for nothing.
When you try to cancel a flight and it doesnt let you online so you call and it is a nearly 2 hour waitthey apparently cancel your flight but you never get a receipt or refund  & then u wait again just so they can tell you to email some vague account.  Sweet  @AmericanAir
