"Why is 
@ATT
 contacting only some of their customers affected by the outage and not all? And offering a credit… wtf ??"
"@FOX2now
 
@KMOV
 So 
@ATT
 is only going to credit their customers $5 for being without service during the nationwide outage. This is newsworthy. Absolutely pathetic. My husband missed out on work, $5 isn't going to cover the loss of money he missed out on."
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
Let it be more than $5 bucks plz!"
" @ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
Oh man what am I going to do with me 5 bucks"
"@ATT
Yeah but $5 not gone make this right….."
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
$5 is a joke."
"@ATT
 soooo yall only giving us a $5 credit? COUNT YOUR DAYS!"
"@BlakeFox4News
Here's the fine print on the 
@ATT
 webpage: ""One $5 credit per account on your AT&T WirelessSM account. Offer does not apply to AT&T Business, AT&T Prepaid or Cricket. Bill credits will typically be applied within 2 bill cycles."""
"I swear 
@ATT
 is a freaking joke!! They are seriously going to credit our account literally $5!! FIVE FREAKING DOLLARS! $5 DOLLARS FOR BEING WITHOUT SERVICE FOR OVER 8 HOURS!!!"
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
It’s five bucks lol don’t put yourself up too high on that horse"
"People couldn't make money and you offer $5? In 2023, ranked 13th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $120.7 billion and you offer your customers $5? 
@ATT"
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
5$?????? #leavingat&t"
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
WTF is this crap?!?! $5 really???? $5 is supposed to help my husband for missing work because he wasn't able to get texts/calls? You gotta be joking right now?! We literally had no service for 8 HOURS!!! you people owe everyone a free bill. $5 is absolutely pathetic!"
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
5 dollars? That’s some bs"
"@DannyHay_
 and 
@ATT
Do this mean the bill gon be cheaper next month ??"
"@ATT
  so for fucking us over for a WHOLE day…. We get a $5 credit… what a fucking joke of a company lmfao"
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
5$!!! ARE U JOKING RN?!?"
"@ATTNEWS
 and 
@ATT
What is $13 credit going to do for all the impact ?"
"So how does 
@ATT
 plan to rectify that outage with their customers? I haven’t heard anything from them since, and it’s honestly making me want to go back to Verizon, lowkey."
"Dear 
@ATT
 -while the thought is appreciated, small business owners that rely on cell service throughout the day, make much more than $5 a day.

I understand that pharmacies & other telecommunications services were also affected but.. I don’t know what to say- thanks? #attoutage"
