@AmericanAir  I have never arrived an 1:45 minutes early and been at risk of missing a domestic flight. You have no one working. What are you doing ?
Hey  @AmericanAir  - why close the gate 10 minutes before a flight is set to depart while a dozen passengers for THAT flight are sitting on the runway for 25+ minutes waiting to deplane?    With no other flights out until the next day.     Thanks for nothing.
When you try to cancel a flight and it doesnt let you online so you call and it is a nearly 2 hour waitthey apparently cancel your flight but you never get a receipt or refund  & then u wait again just so they can tell you to email some vague account.  Sweet  @AmericanAir
"Tough question for everyone today: is  @AmericanAir  the worst run company in the country, or the entire world?"
"The first nonstop American Airlines  @AmericanAir  ?? Miami???? - Ocho Rios???? (Ian Fleming International Airport, Boscobel, St Mary)"
"Endless possibilities for the Ian Flemming International Airport in Boscobel, St Mary.   Today  @AmericanAir  flight AA4007 landed in Jamaica with passengers from Miami. I was pleased to welcome the crew and passengers, representing the first of many that will fly this route."
@AmericanAir  Caught you trying to double the price of the exact same ticket. Claims that the dynamic nature of the ticket is the reason it skyrocketed. Did the value of the dollar lose 1/2 its value? Did your service become twice as good? NO and NO. Not flying AA again
Hey  @AmericanAir  - this FA Ryan is a STAR! On our short SLC to DFW flight he served all 20 of us in Business and even took the time to brief us on our next gate. Amazing. The entire crew was awesome! Great Customer Service.
This just annoyed me. ??  @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir  get your act together.  You delayed my arrival for a business trip such that I arrived at the destination airport two minutes until midnight.  I'm now waiting on the tarmac in CLT because our delayed plane has no open gate.  My flight home started boarding a min ago.
"@AmericanAir  wow Amerian Air how can you let your flight attendance announce such an insulting /derogatory message in PA about Economy passenger not being serve Chicken meal and similar message again about not seving Chicken wrap  Flight 755 Paris to Philly, Fri Feb 23, 2024"
Love being 12 hours late to Denver because of  @AmericanAir  lying about a plane working when it didnt. And the refusing to refund my expenses because I was stuck in the Chicago airport. This is a public shaming tweet hoping they DM me.  #americanairlines
"Flight attendants used to be nice, and any flight over 6 hours should include a meal and a comp beverage. Im looking at you,  @AmericanAir "
Hey  @AmericanAir  - flew from AVL to SJD (Mexico) via CLT yesterday - bag didnt arrive - also didnt arrive today - heard after hours on the phone that someone in Mexico needs to *request* the bag from CLT?? Even though it was supposed to come here the whole time? Still waiting.
@AmericanAir   what do you do with items left on a plane? We left a hat on flight 1600 sjo to mia.
@americanair  Whats the point of allowing people to select their seats when they book a flight for you to just go and change them anyway? .. not everybody is short enough to fit in a non-exit row.
"American Airlines in Augusta GA doesnt know what they are doing! Delay after delay after delay and not a single agent offered vouchers yet! When trying to complain, even the chatbot says you have an attitude!  @AmericanAir  #americanairlines"
  @AmericanAir Had a horrible experience with one of your rude flight attendants on my flight tonight. Completely unprofessional and unacceptable.
"Disappointed with  @AmericanAir  customer service - lengthy wait times and an abrupt cutoff with no resolution. Also, why was I transferred to  @British_Airways  when I need information about a travel segment operated by AA? Hoping for better service next time. #CustomerService"
