'1884036080829096296',"RT @drmarkhyman: The health of America is in crisis—and we need leaders who are ready to face the facts, ask the hard questions, and fight for meaningful change.

I’ve known Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for 20 years. He’s a man of integrity, deeply committed to transforming the health of our nation. He believes in science—not as a set of settled answers, but as a process of asking bold questions and seeking the truth.

Right now, 38% of teens in the U.S. are pre-diabetic. We rank 48th in life expectancy worldwide, despite spending nearly $5 trillion annually on healthcare. Much of this is driven by a broken food system, ultra-processed foods, and a lack of focus on chronic disease prevention.

RFK Jr. is not anti-vaccine. He supports vaccines and has vaccinated his own children. He’s simply asking for transparency, accountability, and rigorous scientific inquiry into the safety and efficacy of all medical interventions—including vaccines. This is not about conspiracies; it’s about ensuring we have honest conversations rooted in data, not dogma.

If you believe in standing up for health, integrity, and truth, you can make your voice heard by calling your senators to express support for RFK Jr.

Here’s how you can help:
-Call or email your senators to advocate for honest leadership in addressing our nation’s health crisis.

This new bombshell revelation dwarfs Gates latest scandal from October of last year when he was caught secretly giving 50 million to the Harris Walz campaign, after Gates publicly claimed he was non partizan and not supporting either party.

Earlier today, Talk Show Host Alex Jones was able to duplicate the findings of other journalists who were able to sign the petition and falsly claim they were doctors against the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr for Secretary of HHS

Its critical to note, journalists first investigated ""the petition"" site because legacy media has been reporting on it as if it is real and not a hoax.

'1882382692454736253',"RT @JimFergusonUK: 🚨 BREAKING: Russia Accuses Bill Gates of Funding Bioterrorism 🚨

In a shocking revelation, Russia's Ministry of Defense (MOD) has accused billionaire Bill Gates of funding ""bioterrorism-related activities"" with the alleged goal of population reduction.

During a high-stakes press briefing, Major General Aleksei Rtishchev, Deputy Chief of the Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces, pointed fingers at the Gates Foundation, claiming it is a primary sponsor of the U.S. African Biolab Complex.

The allegations raise chilling questions about the involvement of global elites in dangerous biological research. Could this mark a turning point in the ongoing global debate about biolabs and their purpose? What is being hidden from the public?

The world waits for answers. 🌍

With Trump back in the White House, its all about to come out.

Newly discovered bank accounts tied to the Biden family reveal millions in laundered funds from China, Romania, and Russia, traced back to Joe Biden's time as VP. Among the findings: $240K in direct wire transfers to Biden himself—with no explanation.

This isn’t just a scandal; it’s a potential crime of historic proportions. The American people deserve answers: Who sent the money? Why? And what was promised in return?

With mounting evidence, is prison time looming for Biden? These revelations could trigger a political earthquake and shake the very foundations of the Biden family.

'1881823787450085549',"RT @BrandonStraka: My judge was Dabney Friedrich. 

Judge Friedrich is responsible for ruling that the  1512 “Obstruction of an Official Proceeding” felony COULD be used against the J6ers. 

This felony charge was used as a weapon to force guilty pleas, and was given to many J6ers who chose to try to defend themselves at trial (100% of them lost). 

Countless people spent years in prison on the 1512 charge, which was as overturned by the Supreme Court this year- for being unconstitutional and wrongfully applied. 

I went through 10 months of torment by the FBI and DOJ before meeting Judge Dabney Friedrich for the first time. 

I honestly believed that when I had the opportunity to stand before a judge, impartiality and fairness would finally come into the picture. 

I couldn’t have been more wrong. 

She was openly hostile, aggressive, contemptuous, irrational, and blindly prejudiced. 

She treated me like a murderer. And she was even worse to my attorneys. 

She seemed to relish in attacking us knowing that the media was listening and lapping up all of the content she was serving up for them. 

As a futile exercise, we filed for early termination of my probation after several years, and Judge Friedrich denied it, stating, “His minimizing of his and others' unlawful acts on January 6 evinces a continued lack of remorse and an ongoing need to protect the public from future crimes”. 

I will spend the rest of my life working to make sure that Judge Dabney Friedrick as well as any of the other January 6th judges never advances in the federal court system, and sure as hell never gets anywhere near our Supreme Court.

I took it to end the nightmare. 

These offers of pardons are, no doubt, admissions that something sinister and treasonous occurred during 45’s first administration. 

Those that take these offers need to understand that if it is found that @POTUS was not fully cognitive during his presidency, they will forever be persecuted by not only the mental abuse of knowing they failed our country but by a relentless spiritual torture that God Almighty will bring into their lives.

How many politicians in the previous UK government are now working for Big Pharma, after pushing mRNA jabs as “safe and effective”?

Meanwhile, in the U.S., https://t.co/l29CA8Iq28 has launched to track former Biden appointees cashing in on their government tenure.

Lobbyist pipelines and revolving doors are fueling corporate influence.

Special interests in Big Pharma, China, Ukraine, and Iran continue to profit from policies crafted under political watch.

The Daily Wire reports that this database will hold these individuals accountable, ensuring transparency and exposing those who may attempt to sabotage the Trump administration or peddle influence from the outside.

It’s time to ask tough questions:

Were decisions on public health driven by profits?
Who is cashing out while the public suffers the consequences?

@alejandrodiazmd 
@RobertKennedyJr 
#MAHA 

In today's substack article, Dr. Alejandro Diaz applauds the intentions of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to provide a Wellness Revolution that emphasizes the use of nutraceuticals to promote and maintain health. 
https://t.co/xWRXfyHcc3

Certainly a switch of the mind set from disease care promulgated by Big Harma to wellness promotion (true health care) would be the foundation for the wellness revolution. However to implement these changes apriori, requires that we understand exactly what causes chronic diseases.  This is where both allopathic and naturopathic medicine get it wrong. 

As discussed in detail in my 2015 new immunosenescence paradigm (of macrophages):

""Laderoute MP. A new paradigm about HERV-K102 particle production and blocked release to explain cortisol mediated immunosenescence and age-associated risk of chronic disease. Discov Med. 2015 Dec;20:379-91.""

[https://t.co/nh17fuQeAY]

and again when this paradigm was validated for atherosclerosis-cardiovascular disease (ASCVD):

""Laderoute M. The paradigm of immunosenescence in atherosclerosis-cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Discov Med. 2020 Jan-Feb;29(156):41-51.""  

[https://t.co/kAVSZcST5u]

it is the immunosenescence of macrophages or ""pathological dysfunction of macrophages""  that causes chronic disease but not the normal activation of macrophages that generates ""inflammation"" and a protective response against pathogens and tumors. 

Thus, to focus on inflammation per se as the cause of disease we can easily conclude cannot be true! 

While it remains to be conclusively demonstrated and/or acknowledged, since the time of my Ph.D. thesis (1991) where I characterized the 67 kD alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) receptor on macrophages and notably as also strongly overexpressed on common cancers (the adenocarcinomas like breast, colon, lung, prostate, etc.), I have been strongly advocating that ""active AFP""  generates the pathological dysfunction of macrophages tied to the onset and progression of chronic (and infectious) disease.  

AFP exists in active and inactive states where most notably zinc and DHEA inactivate (DHEA is the youth hormone that provides protection against the stress hormone cortisol, the cause of all illness)  while copper and TGFB1 may activate.  

Most significant is that with stress and as we age, the levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) decline, and more rapidly in men than women. Thus, as we age and/or become stressed, AFP when produced is more likely to remain active due to the loss of DHEA.  Indeed, it is well substantiated in the literature that the DHEA/cortisol ratio declines significantly with the onset and progression of disease. 

It is notable that at least in Canada, medical and hospital laboratories do NOT test for DHEA (the active youth hormone) but instead test for DHEA-S (the inactive form of DHEA).  Remarkably, DHEA-S or the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio does not correlate with disease onset or progression. 

The truth of the matter is that immunosenescence caused by AFP binding to the 67 kD AFP receptor is a state of dysfunction where the macrophage is no longer able to respond to signals.  Uniquely, AFP blocks any incoming signal (uniquely imparts a negative signal making the cell appear to be rogue with its own agenda) whether it is for activation, apoptosis or even to shut off the production and release of proinflammatory factors in the macrophage. So during immunosenescence the macrophage is immunosuppressed but at the same time paradoxically it is releasing pro-inflammatory factors in an uncontrolled manner.  

(The 67 kD AFPr apparently is only expressed after the signal to differentiate from the M0 state to the M1 state of macrophages which locks in the production and release of pro-inflammatory factors). 

To use immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory agents like turmeric or statins, does not deal with the cause only the symptoms of immunosenescence.  In all probability over time, it just causes health to decline.

Instead, as shown below, to prevent or reverse chronic disease (as caused by immunosenescence), one must employ AFP antagonists, agents that convert active AFP to inactive and/or those that modify the pathway triggered by AFP.  Vitamin D may be an example of the latter (interestingly, the vitamin D binding protein GC, is related to AFP). 

A huge breakthrough in chronic disease management has been the discovery that ivermectin appears to be the most potent AFP antagonist ever demonstrated: 

""Laderoute M. Ivermectin may prevent and reverse immunosenescence by antagonizing alpha-fetoprotein and downmodulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR hyperactivity. Open Heart, April 29, 2021. https://t.co/dcddRpuH6T.""

Dr. William Makis and others such as Dr. Paul Marik, have been successfully using ivermectin in cases of rapid progression of tumors (the so-called 'turbo cancers') and have talked about how ivermectin might be useful more generally for chronic diseases in addition to its known powerful ability to counteract viruses.   It turns out that pathogenic infectious agents seem to induce immunosenescence (for example the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2) which places the host at very high risk of death [Laderoute, M. Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of Infection into Macrophages Validates the Importance of HERV-K102 Particle Production for Pandemic Preparedness. Preprints 2023, 2023120185.  https://t.co/93FDEAfMPb. DOI: 10.20944/preprints202312.0185.v2]. 

Notably immunosenescence caused by the entry of pathogens into foamy macrophages usually by antibody dependent enhancement of infection into foamy macrophages (see image on the right below), converts the protector M1-like macrophage producing the protector HERV-K102 particles (where release is by apoptosis/cell lysis) to the M2-like highly inflammatory dysfunctional foamy macrophages that reproduces the pathogen unabated as it is an immunologically privileged site. Notably vitamin D3 levels over 50 ng/ml block this transition.  Maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D3 is key to human survival and has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality.    

So monitoring levels of Vitamin D3, DHEA and the DHEA/cortisol ratio along with blood pressure, BMI, and even resting pulse, would be integral to the performance measurement of the wellness revolution. 

Anti-inflammatories per se (like statins and turmeric and even NSAIDs) have no role in the reestablishment of wellness except for highly specialized temporary interventions meant to reverse long COVID-19 or post COVID-19 vaccine syndromes (as described by Dr. Bruce Patterson).",en,Retweet,0,2,1,0,174,2024-12-28 11:37:41,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",#MAHA,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gf5XndcWQAA9_MD.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gf5fiPuXwAAqGZg.jpg"

'1865820571889697108',"RT @JohnStrandUSA: Dear President @realDonaldTrump:

I felt compelled to write directly to you about the plight of January 6 victims, and because this travesty is far too grave to be lost in the shuffle—you are the busiest man on earth, for which we are supremely grateful—I took the liberty of sharing this publicly. I pray you will forgive the impertinence, and I pray others will ensure you can receive this message.

I don’t need to convince you of this, but the J6 witch hunt carried out by the Biden/Merrick Garland DOJ—still continuing this very moment—is a brazenly politicized weaponization of the government against American citizens, including yourself. I am unaware of any precedent for such an egregious abuse of government power at this scale in our nation’s history—it is an enormous and eternal stain on our national legacy as “One Nation Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.”

It is also a terrifying shift toward totalitarianism, chilling political speech and making it crystal clear to citizens that if they dare to criticize their government, they face a very real threat of prison and the total destruction of their lives.

This is only made worse by mounting evidence of government actors having conspired and participated in the setup and facilitation of unfortunate events that transpired on that fateful day, and the nation is watching @RepLoudermilk and @RepClayHiggins closely, with expectation that our Congress will properly perform its oversight duties to secure a comprehensive investigation and transparent findings on these deeply concerning issues. We also expect @PamBondi and @Kash_Patel to immediately support those efforts, and to ensure the truth is revealed and those truly guilty of crimes are caught, prosecuted, and punished appropriately (see: @Liz_Cheney, @AdamSchiff, et. al.)

But regardless of those findings, what is abundantly clear already is that the current Merrick Garland/Matthew Graves DOJ, in obvious cooperation with the D.C. district courts, has obliterated Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees enshrined in our Constitution, among many other horrendous acts of malice and deceit that are wildly unethical, and in many cases illegal. This has resulted in two extremely serious problems, both of which require courageous leadership and executive authority that only you, Mr. President, can provide.

The first problem is the Constitutional crisis presented by this DOJ and D.C. Courts debacle; if we do not enforce Due Process and Equal Protection, then our Constitution is a dead letter, and our Republic will perish. On this basis alone, *ALL* J6 defendants must be immediately released, and *ALL* current J6 prosecutorial actions by the Garland DOJ must be halted. You can accomplish this on Day One with executive orders.

The second problem is no less urgent, and that is the incredible suffering of J6 victims and their families. The damage to these citizens is literally incalculable; suffice it to say their lives, current and future, are utterly destroyed. The worst part is, most of them are truly, ENTIRELY innocent; they had zero criminal intent, and in fact were bravely participating in a sacred civic duty with the ostensible protection of the explicit provisions of the First Amendment.

Mr. President, I cannot urge you strongly enough to recognize the unique opportunity and responsibility you have in this moment to restore both the First Amendment along with the entire Bill of Rights, and the innocent J6ers who should have been shielded by it. To do this, you must dismantle the nefarious and exceedingly perilous false narrative of a “violent insurrection” by making a formal declaration of the truth: that all defendants have been harmed by Constitutional violations, and ALSO that most defendants have been falsely smeared as “violent” when those allegations are routinely bogus and/or manipulated by a wildly corrupt DOJ and others.

Therefore, along with this crucial declaration, you can do what is right and just by issuing *two* very different, very important, “pardons” related to J6 defendants. The first is a simple blanket pardon of mercy offered to *all* current defendants based on broad constitutional violations. But for those who had no criminal intent and committed no overt destructive act (self-defense in scuffles initiated by police abuse-of-force, which was prevalent and well documented, obviously does not qualify)—and this is true of the vast majority of defendants—they are truly innocent victims of a historic government-driven tragedy, and they MUST be made whole again with a proclamation-style “Pardon of Innocence” that nullifies all J6-related legal action against them, with complete expungement of any criminal record, and a formal statement establishing their innocence, exemplary patriotism, and historic suffering on behalf of their country, along with a recommendation or executive order mandating restitution to restore them from the severe damages and suffering they have sustained.

I pray once again, Mr. President, that you will forgive my boldness; but I could never forgive myself if I retreated even slightly from doing everything in my power to help rescue these bravest of patriots who have unjustly suffered more than most could possibly imagine. Sadly, I don’t have to imagine, because I personally endured some of the worst of it, including a horrific saga of wildly illegal isolation abuse. Your son @DonaldJTrumpJr saw me testify to this. That experience has only galvanized my resolve to pursue justice, relentlessly, until it has been fully served, and to continue serving my country in whatever manner God may call me to in the coming months. I wish to thank you for your bold choice in previously nominating the stalwart @MattGaetz who has been a tremendous ally in our fight for #JusticeForJ6 and I know Mr. Gaetz, along with myself and other advocates, stand ready to serve our country alongside you in carrying out this critical endeavor to restore the Constitution and the many J6 patriots who fought, suffered, and died for it.

Deep beneath a granite hill, China’s Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is gearing up to chase neutrinos—those sneaky ""ghost particles"" that’ve been zooming around since the Big Bang. 

Built 2,297 feet underground to dodge cosmic noise, JUNO will fire up in 2025.

The mission? Catch antineutrinos from nearby nuclear plants and finally figure out their mass hierarchy—because ranking the lightest-to-heaviest ghost particles is apparently a thing.

With Japan’s Hyper-Kamiokande and the U.S. Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment coming online later this decade, the race to decode the universe’s origins is on.

Simply because they support a man who could change things for real.

During the years Democrats have been in charge, our nation has become an authoritarian dystopia, where:

- the legal system is weaponized, 
- ruling elitists are above the law, 
- hundreds of billions of taxpayers' money have been sent to Ukraine (and into politicians' own pockets), 
- and a private social credit system is in place to ruin dissidents' lives.

'1866558356023816486',"RT @RealJoePortman: 🚨 The TRUTH about Russiagate EXPOSED 🚨

Roger Stone just called out Barack Obama for what may be the greatest abuse of power in U.S. history—and he’s 100% right. The Russian Collusion Hoax wasn’t just a political smear; it was a full-blown attack on democracy that wrecked lives, destroyed careers, and almost brought this nation to its knees.

Think about it:
🔹 Years of lies fed to the public by the media and government officials.
🔹 Millions of dollars wasted on investigations that uncovered ZERO evidence of collusion.
🔹 Innocent people like Michael Flynn, Carter Page, and others dragged through the mud, their reputations permanently tarnished.
🔹 Meanwhile, the real abuses of power by the FBI, DOJ, and high-ranking officials were swept under the rug.

And the mastermind? Barack Obama and his inner circle, who weaponized our intelligence agencies to target political opponents. This wasn’t just dirty politics; it was an attempted coup.
The Racket News piece lays out the remnants of this fiasco, showing how it STILL impacts our nation today. Russiagate wasn’t just a hoax—it was a blueprint for corruption, setting the stage for further abuses of power.

📢 We can’t let this stand. The people behind this need to be held accountable. The truth about Obama’s role in this scandal must come out.
What do you think? Should there be a full investigation into Obama’s administration and its role in Russiagate?

Let’s hear your thoughts below! 👇

When a person has a spinal cord injury, the connection between the brain and leg muscles is damaged, making it hard or impossible to walk.

Research shows the hypothalamus, a brain region known for controlling emotions and motivation, plays a role in walking recovery.

Deep brain stimulation sends electrical pulses to specific brain areas, activating hypothalamus neurons that help restore walking ability.

The treatment creates new communication routes around the injury through a relay station in the brain stem.

Tests with mice and rats showed stronger stimulation improved walking ability, while turning off the neurons reduced walking ability.

The treatment was tested in two human patients with spinal cord injuries who needed help to walk, and both showed better walking performance without serious side effects.

While the results of this treatment are promising, larger trials with more patients would be needed to further establish safety and efficacy before this treatment could be considered for FDA approval.",en,Retweet,25,171,10,26,78165,2024-12-09 00:34:19,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Now, it all makes sense.

Have you noticed anyone in your family change after taking the COVID-19 injection?

Well, a recent Korean study provides compelling evidence that the vaccine itself may be the cause.

Epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher reported, “COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a 68.3% increased risk of depression, a 43.9% increased risk of anxiety disorders, and a 93.4% increased risk of sleep disorders,” based on the study’s findings.

Going further, Hulscher commented, “U.S. depression rates have risen to record highs since 2020/2021, partly due to the draconian pandemic control measures (lockdowns, mask mandates, job losses) and, as suggested by Kim et al. [study’s authors], COVID-19 vaccination.”

""If you take a look at autism, you go back 25 years. Autism was almost nonexistent. It was, you know, one out of 100,000 and now it's close to one out of 100.""

""Something is going on. I don't know if it's vaccines. Maybe it's maybe it's chlorine in the water, right? People are looking at a lot of different things. I want them to look at everything.""

'1865060672159076355',"RT @ElonClipsX: Here’s Elon Musk in 2003 outlining the strategic plan SpaceX has been following until today.

“Our approach is really to make this a solid, sound business.

I predicated the strategic plan on a known market, something that we know for a fact exists, which is the need to put small to medium-sized satellites into orbit. That's what we're going after initially.

And then, with that as a revenue base, we will move into the human transportation market.

The long-term aims of the company are definitely human transportation.

I think the smart strategy is to first go for cargo delivery, essentially satellite delivery.

And our eventual upgrade path is to build the successor to Saturn V, build a super-heavy lift vehicle that could be used for setting up a moon base or doing a Mars mission.

That would be the holy grail objective.”

'1864742206667681967',"RT @KennyCarmody: Pfizer’s vaccine sequence has turned up in biopsies – biopsies from vaccinated individuals who later developed tumors.There were identified SV40 sequences from Pfizer’s vaccine in those tumors. And it’s not diluted. It’s at a copy number so high it looks like it’s replicating inside these tumors. This isn’t just DNA lingering; it’s integrating and growing.

We’re seeing disturbing trends. Increased cancers, immunosuppression, lymphocytopenia – our immune systems are being degraded. And yet, our health agencies refuse to face the obvious. They pretend this is all perfectly normal. They don’t want you to question anything. But the signs are there, and they’re terrifying.

Regulators, from the EMA to Health Canada, claim these contaminants don’t matter, aren’t functional, aren’t an issue. But they know. Internal emails reveal their panic, their requests for Pfizer to clean up its DNA, only to be met with excuses. Pfizer doesn’t even have a proper test to measure DNA length in these vials. They’re giving us half-truths and lies.

The science is unequivocal: DNA fragments, in lipid nanoparticles, can integrate into human genomes. Chronic exposure to foreign DNA, floating in the cytosol, triggers a cascade of immune responses that can lead to cancer. This isn’t just my opinion; it’s backed by literature, and it’s blatantly ignored by regulatory agencies.

We’ve heard excuse after excuse from regulators. “It’s too little to matter,” “It won’t enter cells,” “It won’t reach the nucleus.” Each claim has fallen apart. They retreat at every challenge, changing the story to suit their agenda. The fact is, they know the truth, but they won’t admit it. It’s a deliberate cover-up on a scale we’ve never seen before.

This is no longer about health. This is about power, control, and deceit. The regulators are defending their sponsors, rewriting guidelines, hiding behind blacked-out documents. They’ve crossed a line. This isn’t just a scandal. This is RICO territory. This is collusion, manipulation, a violation of our basic rights and trust.

To everyone reading this: our health agencies have abandoned us. They’re complicit in the greatest violation of medical ethics in modern history. Do not trust their lies. Demand transparency. Refuse to be silenced. We must hold every single one of these actors accountable.

 weaponizing the legal system to suppress political candidates; 

failure in USSS arrangements which led to (almost) assassination of political candidates; and so on.

One of the little-reported aspects of Ukraine and first impeachment: in and around March 2019, Ukraine prosecutors Lutsenko and Konstantin Kulyk wanted to visit US DOJ to discuss connections of US to Ukrainian corruption. Burisma was one issue, but there were several others. The US embassy denied visas and prevented their trip.  Anti-corruptionist Tetiana Chornovol (a radical Azov, but an actual anti-corruptionist) sent a pleading letter to the DOJ, but got nowhere.  Subsequently, they tried to get in contact with US officials via Giuliani.  Solomon's April 2019 articles were written in this context. It was Solomon's articles that triggered Eric Ciaramella into his subsequent intrigues that led to first impeachment.

Again, the Senate is not supposed to block any of President Trump's nominations. The reason they oppose is not because of the nominees' qualifications or foreign asset allegations which are a hoax, but solely because they want to install their own people into the cabinet.

'1863599726383210585',"RT @BubblesKitty22: A Case for Trump's Pursuit of Election Integrity: Why the 2020 Election Deserves Another Look

In an era where public trust in our electoral system is paramount, the initiative by President-elect Donald Trump to challenge and investigate the 2020 election through the Department of Justice (DOJ) should not be dismissed outright but rather examined for its potential merits. Here's why:

**The Quest for Transparency**

Elections are the bedrock of democracy, and any citizen, especially a former president, has a right, if not a duty, to question anomalies that might have influenced the outcome. The 2020 election was unlike any other, with unprecedented circumstances including mass mail-in voting due to the global health crisis. This alone warrants a thorough review to ensure that the electoral process was conducted with the utmost integrity. 

**The Role of the DOJ**

The Department of Justice exists to ensure justice, uphold the law, and protect the rights of American citizens. If there are credible claims or even the shadow of doubt about the legality of how votes were cast, counted, or certified, it is within the mandate of the DOJ to investigate these concerns. The argument that this is merely a political maneuver ignores the DOJ's responsibility to act when allegations of electoral misconduct arise, regardless of who raises them.

**Legal and Historical Precedence**

The U.S. has a history of revisiting election outcomes. From the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1876 to the Florida recount in 2000, legal challenges have been part of the American electoral process. These precedents show that questioning election results is not only legal but has been deemed necessary when the integrity of the vote is in question. Furthermore, Trump's pursuit is within the bounds of law; the Constitution does not bar a sitting or incoming president from using executive powers to ensure electoral integrity.

**The Need for Accountability**

If irregularities occurred, whether through oversight, malice, or external influence, those responsible must be held accountable. An investigation led by the DOJ could serve as a deterrent for future misconduct, reinforcing the principle that no one is above the law, not even in matters as significant as presidential elections. This isn't about overturning an election; it's about ensuring that future elections are beyond reproach.

**Public Trust**

Perhaps most crucially, investigating the 2020 election could restore public trust in the electoral system. A significant portion of the population questioned the results of the 2020 election. Ignoring these concerns does not make them disappear but rather sows further distrust. By addressing these issues head-on, the administration can demonstrate a commitment to the democratic process over political expediency.

**Countering the Critics**

Critics might argue this is an abuse of power or an attempt to undermine democracy. However, transparency in government should be welcomed. If the investigation finds no wrongdoing, it would affirm the legitimacy of the 2020 election results, potentially silencing skeptics once and for all. On the other hand, if issues are uncovered, corrective measures can be implemented, strengthening our electoral system.

**Conclusion**

The call for an investigation into the 2020 election by President-elect Trump is not an act of political vendetta but an exercise in due diligence. It reflects a commitment to the sanctity of our vote and the integrity of our democratic institutions. While the process must be conducted with the highest level of professionalism, impartiality, and adherence to the law, the pursuit of truth in our electoral process should be above partisan politics. It's time to look forward, but not before ensuring that our backward glance confirms the robustness of our nation's democratic foundations. 

This isn't just about one election; it's about setting a precedent for all future elections, ensuring they are not just fair, but undeniably so.",en,Retweet,1,9,3,1,322,2024-12-02 10:02:53,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
